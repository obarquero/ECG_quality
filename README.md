ECG_quality
===========

This code implements the ECG quality approach based on using eigenvalues from the correlation matrix of the 8 independent leads plus some simple tree approach to evaluate the quality of the ECG. 

This code was written in Java and under the development framework created for the Physionet/Challenge 2011. The actual implementaion is done in the ChallengeEntry.java class which is call by the Challenge_Runner.java main class. All in /src/org/physionet/challenge2011/ folder.

This code is based on the paper. If you use this code pleas consider to cite us:
